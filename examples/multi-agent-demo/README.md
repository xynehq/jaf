## JAF Multi-Agent Patterns Demo

This example demonstrates the four core multi-agent orchestration patterns:

- Sequential pipeline
- Parallel pipeline
- Coordinator routing
- Parallel redundant evaluation

Agents use a simple mock model provider so no external services are required.

### Run

```
pnpm -F jaf-multi-agent-demo dev
```

Each pattern's result will be printed to the console.
